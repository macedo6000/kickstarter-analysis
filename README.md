# Kickstart Analysis with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Overview of Project
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, is starting a crowdfund campaign to help fund her play titled Fever. She needs insight on the dataset provided in order for her play to be a success.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals using visualizations. The main category trends will be focused on is theater/plays to determine campaign outcomes: successful, failed, and canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
Prior to analyzing and creating visualizations for the crowdfunding campaign, the data must first be organized, sorted, and analyzed. First, the Outcomes column was color coded to help the individual outcomes stand out. Then, the category/subcategory column was separated and placed in their own column. Also, the unix timestamps were converted to readable format.
