# Kickstart Analysis with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter campaign data using pivot tables and graphs using excel.

## Overview of Project
This analysis was performed to compare how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals using visualizations. The main category trends focused on theater/plays to determine campaign outcomes: successful, failed, and canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
The initial Kickstarter campaign data was received in an excel file, where the data was cleaned, organized, and analyzed. Additional spreadsheets and pivot tables/graphs were created to further analyze the data.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- A pivot table and line graph was created to visualize the theater outcomes based on launch date. Success, failed, and canceled outcomes are represented by lines.

- The "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line graph shows that May and June have the best results for meeting goals.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- The visualized funding goals analysis below shows that funding goals less than $1,000 has an almost 80% success rate.

#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- A challenge or difficulty that could be had is enter an incorrect character in a function and not double checking function as entered. This can cause difficulty because one may have to back track on the steps to find the problem.

### Results

- Two conclusions taken from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date are:
    1. May and June are the most successful months to reach funding goals.
    2. October had the highest failure rate, making it the least favorable month to campaign for funds.

- My conclusion about the Outcomes Based on Goals are that setting lower funding goals have a higher success rate than high funding goals.

- The limitations on this dataset is demographics on the backers. Having more information on the people funding the goals would help to determine how to better increase pledges.

- Some other tables or graphs to create, that would be very helpful, are for the average donations according to subcategory and Backers_count to subcategories.
